## Creating and Structuring Documentation Pages

You start by creating pages directly in the editor. Use the sidebar to nest pages under sections, forming a logical hierarchy. Maycon Mota supports full MDX, so embed components like `<Callout>` or code blocks seamlessly.

<Steps>
  <Step title="New Page" icon="plus">
    Click the `+ New Page` button in the sidebar.

    Choose a parent folder for organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Content" icon="edit-3">
    Write in Markdown or switch to visual mode.

## Your Section

<Callout kind="info">

````

  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish" icon="upload">
    Save and publish. Changes go live instantly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use YAML frontmatter for SEO: `title` and `description` fields optimize discoverability.

## Version Control and History Tracking

Every edit creates a commit, like Git. You view diffs, restore versions, or compare changes.

<Expandable title="View History" default-open="true">
  Right-click a page > `View History`.

  Select a version to preview or restore.

## Search and Filtering Tools

Navigate large docs effortlessly. The global search indexes all content, supporting full-text and filters.

| Filter Type | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| By Tag | Filter by custom labels | `api`, `guide` |
| By Date | Recent changes only | `>2024-01-01` |
| By Author | Team member contributions | `@username` |

<CodeGroup tabs="Search API,Advanced Query">
  ```javascript
  // Search via API
  const results = await fetch('https://api.example.com/search?q=authentication');
  ```
  ```javascript
  // Filter with params
  const advanced = await fetch('https://api.example.com/search?q=auth&filter=tag:api&after=2024-01-01');
  ```
